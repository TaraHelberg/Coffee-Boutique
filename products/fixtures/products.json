         "description":"The Genio Touch Pod Coffee Machine is a compact redesign of its big brother - the Gusto Pod Coffee Machine. However, the Genio Touch is not just a copy, because under the soft shapes hides a capsule machine with its own distinctive personality. Genio Touch is designed to make optimal use of space. It is therefore lower and narrower than its predecessor, but in return it has a bit more depth. The drip tray is designed to be height-adjustable, so there is plenty of room for both a small espresso cup or a large coffee mug. The water tank is elegantly part of the curved design and has a capacity of 0.8 litres. As with other models, you will find the classic touch display of the Gusto machine on the rounded front panel. When your cup is brewed, the machine stops automatically and shuts itself off after 1 minute of inactivity. Even when the coffee brews with the maximum 15 bar pressure there is no need to worry about your electricity bill. The machine is classified as energy class A + . If you prefer an extra strong cup of coffee, you can brew it with Espresso Boost technology. For an extra large cup, you simply select the XL function. To brew, just insert your chosen capsule, and set the cup with the user-friendly Play & Select function, and in no time your coffee is ready. If you want to spoil the kids with a cup of hot cocoa or you fancy a hot tea on a cold winter evening, the Genio Touch will be happy to oblige. Maintenance and cleaning are straightforward. With its minimalist design, the easily removable parts can be put in the dishwasher, and the rest of the Genio Touch can be cleaned with a damp cloth. Of course, you have access to the entire large Dolce Gusto® capsule universe, where you can choose from up to 50 different varieties. Whether you are into coffee, tea or cocoa, or you feel like experimenting with more exotic drinks like a Cappuccino or Latte, you are not going to run out options very quickly. In short, you get a machine with a practical and user-friendly design that will easily fit in most places and, if we say so ourselves, doesn’t look half bad either. Product details: • Automatic control for faster brewing, • High pressure (up to 15 bar) for rich taste and high crema, • Supports over 50 varieties in different cup sizes (e.g. NESCAFÉ Dolce Gusto® ® & STARBUCKS, Tea, Cocoa). • Compact size: 27 x 12 x 28 cm (Height, width, length), • Energy saving: Turns off automatically after 1 minute of inactivity. • Energy class A +, • 2 years guarantee. When you buy this machine, you get a free adapter",
