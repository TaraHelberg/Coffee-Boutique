## Agile Method Git Projects

GitHub projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to project [Kanban Board](https://github.com/TaraHelberg/Coffee-Boutique/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

Not all Epics / User Stories have made it into the project using the MSCW Method you will find on the Kanban Must haveâ€™s, Should Haveâ€™s, Could Have's and Wonâ€™t have labels. 
The wonâ€™t have labelled sections are those that did not make it into the App due to time constraint

[Back to top â‡§](#contents)

## Future Features

Although only a few are represented in the Kanban the E-commerce store that I have made has loads of potential for numerous extra features and futher development and I will be honest and say that if I put in all my Future features in that I could think of this readme would be extensive :)

1. User Story: Product Image to Expand on Hover Over

   As a Shop Owner I can give my Shoppers a better look at the Product when they hover over the Product it expands and shows more detail so that my shoppers / users can see the product in more detail possibly making them purchase it as it gives them a better idea of the products.

2. User Story: Product Price Change on Selection of Size

   As a Shop Owner I can have the price of my products change if the product has a size & that size is selected the price either decreases or increases accordingly so that when a Shopper / User selects a size on the product they are given the accurate price according to size and my company gets paid the correct price for the product.

 3. Epics : Discount Coupon

    As a Shop Owner I require to give Discount Coupons that a Shopper can see & use so that it encourages shoppers / user to make that first purchase.

 Other Future Features include using Product variants to manage not only the change in Price for size difference but for product colour selection.

 The abitity to make up your own Gift set by selecting from excisting Products.

 Getting a weekly mailing list of Discounts , New products and interesting Blog Post to those who have subscribed to the mailing list.

 This is to name just a few.

# Design


## Colour Scheme

As I decided to do my e-commerce app on Coffee & Coffee Products as a Coffee Lover myself I decided to go with tradional colours that are associated with coffee and complement each other natrualy.
Chooseing to got with a Main text color of Coffee , Background colour of cream and for enhancment and effect Gold for the Deliver Banner and hover / button colour changes.
White text has been used where applicable for visablity.

It was decided that when in use the Shopping cart icon had a very distinct in use color.

It was also decide that in the Blog for external links & content credit links that they have a color of there own so as to be more visabile.

## Product Descriptions

### Coffee

Coffee - Beans, Grounds & Pods descriptions : Names of the Coffees are made up as are the descriptions, having re-searched, read and drunk a lot of Coffee myself, been an avid Coffee Lover. The descriptions use the standard format of how I have seen coffee described.

### Coffee Machines

Coffee Machines - Capsule Pod, Coffee Makers & Espresso : Here I had to use product descriptions from a number of online resources as I felt for authenticity that a better description of the actual product was require than that which I could make up myself. I have tried to match the description as closely to the free product image I was able to obtain, however in some case the product image and the product description link are slightly different but as close as I could find. 

Names in these have been altered on certain products to suite the product pictures which I was able to obtain from free image sites, however product images that have very clear product names have been kept the same or altered only slightly.

Please find below links to the descriptions I have used.

    The 1st been a django.db.utils.IntegrityError: Problem installing fixtures.

    ![Add Review Error](assets/readme-images/Bugs/addreview-error.png) 
    

11. Delete Review Errors , displayed in the the Django 404 yellow error page.
    The delete review pose a problem that originated in the redirect as I wish to redirect the shopper from the delete page back to the original product the review had been on .
    I found that the redirect was causing problems as it would not redirect with a simple delete_review view.
    I had to use the form method very similar to the edit_review view in order for this to worok.
    Each error was solved some by myself & others with the assistace for Tutor support.

    Error 1 : NoReverseMatch - Unlike a lot of simple url errors this one cause a lot of problems until I update the view to use the form similar to the edit_review view. Herdal number 1 solved. This error was caused due to trying to redirect back to the product that had the review on it & was the start of the bugs for this Delete review.


    ![Delete Review Error 1](assets/readme-images/Bugs/deletereview-noreversematch-error.png)


    Error 2 : Attribute Error - This error was made by not calling the delete into the delete_review form and was correct by calling the review.delete() into the form.


    ![Delete Review Error 2](assets/readme-images/Bugs/deletereview-atribute-error.png)


    Error 3 : Unbound Local Error - This error was made due to calling the review = review.delete() only withough getting the object first causing the error local variable 'review' referenced before assignment.
    This was corrected by calling the review = get_object_or_404(Review, pk=review_id) first.


    ![Delete Review Error 3](assets/readme-images/Bugs/deletereview-unboundlocal-error.png)


    Error 4 : Attribute tuple product Error - This error was made due to calling the review = review.delete() above the product = review.product.
    This was corrected by moving the review = review.delete() into the if statement as you can not call it from outside of the if statement.


    ![Delete Review Error 4](assets/readme-images/Bugs/deletereview-atribute-tuple-product-error.png)


    Error 5 : Attribute tuple _meta Error - This error was made due to calling the review = review.delete() in the if statement.
    This was corrected by removing the review = as it should be called as only review.delete().
    This error was resloved with the assistance of Tutoring.
    Delete Review now redirect the Shopper back to the product assosciated with the review. 


    ![Delete Review Error 5](assets/readme-images/Bugs/deletereview-atribute-tupple-meta-error.png)
    

12. Image Rendering Error - errors for all images 404 was shown in the gitpod.io terminal.
    I had added a products folder to the Media folder as the folder was getting very full and had other images in it.
    The error was traced to the image pather been /media/ without been able to pick up the /products/ folder.
    This was resolved by adding the upload_to='products/' to the Products model running migrations & from the admin backend putting all the images back in.


    ![Image Rendering Error 5](assets/readme-images/Bugs/allimagesrendering-error.png)


13.  Favourite Products model errors - displayed in the the Django 404 yellow error page & in the gitpod.io terminal.
     I had planned on having a model for Favourites . However after numberous try's & delete's & redos the favourites became part of the products model.
     I felt that I was not getting anywhere after 3/4 days of codeing and that I needed to move on in order to complete the PP but still have the user story in place.
     Below are 2 examples of the error's I had gotten .
     They are resolved by exluding the model & making a diffrent plan to show the favourites, in oder to keep the user story favourites.


     ![Favourites Error 1](assets/readme-images/Bugs/addfavourites-error.png)


     ![Favourites Error 2](assets/readme-images/Bugs/addfavourites-terminal-error.png)


14. Contact Us Error - displayed in the the Django 404 yellow error page ,TemplateDoesNot Exist.
    It was determined after inspecting the error message from Django 404 yellow page, that the error was due to a bad path to the template.
    Research was done and found that due to the templates/company_info/ folders used that the conact_us.html file was not been picked up from the views as the path was currently rendering from return render(request, 'contact_us.html', {'form': form}).
    Error was corrected by putting the company_info/ into the render.

    This was assisted by reading the following froms tack over flow : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1926049/django-templatedoesnotexist.

# Deployment

This project was deployed using Github and Heroku.

- ## Github 

    * To create a new repository, I took the following steps:

        + Logged into GitHub.
        + Click the â€˜repositoriesâ€™ section.
        + Click the green â€˜newâ€™ button to create new repository.
        + Choose â€˜repository templateâ€™ Used the code institute template as recommended from the dropdown menu.
        + Add repository name then clicked the green â€˜create repository buttonâ€™ at the bottom of the page.
        + Open the new repository and clicked the green â€˜Gitpodâ€™ button to create a workspace in Gitpod for editing.

- ## Django and Heroku

    To get the Django framework installed and set up I followed the Code institutes . & Revisited the Walkthrough to assist.
    However due to changes made by Heroku changes were made when this occurred & information received from Code Institute.
    
    #### Final Deployment 
    DEBUG = False

    X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'SAMEORIGIN' 

    In Heroku go to Reveal Congfig Vars  
    Remove Disbable_Collectstatic

    Go to Deploy Tab & Deploy Branch
   
   + Note : Safety & Security : From the start of this PP I have had an env.py file that I have kept the secret key's in particular the Django Secret Key however after deployment I felt that for saftery & security although my secret key's had been kept in an env.py file, I could not be 100% sure that the secret key had not been pushed through to git due to the manner in which I had use the env.py file and settings.py file at the start of the App. I decided to use a Django key generator & add a new Django secret key to my env.py file & to heroku config vars to sensure that should the key have been push by accident that it was now an invalid key.
     

- ## Clone Project 

    * Cloning of Project was made possible by GitHub
        + Go to Git Hub
        + Go to the repository 
        + Click on it to go to main repository site
